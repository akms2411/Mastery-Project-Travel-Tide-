Masterschool Project

This master project presents a fully customer segmentation strategy for Travel Tide that focuses on personalized perks and data-driven insights. 
The analysis focuses on increasing customer satisfaction and optimizing revenue through targeted offers. 
Key metrics and behavioral patterns form the basis for this strategic approach. I provide recommendations for implementation.

## Project Description

## SQL Database Design

## Data-based analysis

Data Analysis Foundation Travel Tide's segmentation strategy is built on robust data requirements including 4,413 total users analyzed. 
The analysis covers customers with minimum 7 sessions and 2+ booked trips from January 2023 onwards. Six distinct customer segments were 
identified based on fully travel behavior patterns. The precise algorithm incorporates age, marital status, and travel patterns for accurate categorization.

## Segment "Mature Single"

The Mature Single segment represents the largest customer group with 1,664 users (37.7% of total customer base). These customers are aged 35-64, unmarried, 
and demonstrate flexible travel patterns with premium spending preferences. They show strong interest in cultural experiences and educational tours, prioritizing 
quality over cost. The recommended perk focuses on premium experiences and cultural tour packages.

## Segment "Couple Traveler"

Couple Travelers constitute 1,030 users (23.3%) and are characterized as married individuals without children aged 35-64. They typically travel in pairs 
and prioritize romantic experiences and quality time together. Common experiences and shared activities are highly valued by this segment. 
The tailored perk offers romantic upgrades and couples spa packages.

## Segment "Family Traveler"

These are 717 travelers (16.3 %) who are characterized by the fact that they have children and a longer trip duration of more than 5 nights. 
Over 30% of their trips take place during summer vacations and require multiple seats with a higher luggage capacity. They prefer apartment-style 
stays with multiple rooms to meet the needs of the family. The benefits package includes offers such as “kids fly free” and entertainment packages for families.
