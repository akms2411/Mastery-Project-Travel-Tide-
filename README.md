## SQL Database Design

## Data-based analysis

Data Analysis Foundation Travel Tide's segmentation strategy is built on robust data requirements including 4,413 total users analyzed. 
The analysis covers customers with minimum 7 sessions and 2+ booked trips from January 2023 onwards. Six distinct customer segments were 
identified based on fully travel behavior patterns. The precise algorithm incorporates age, marital status, and travel patterns for accurate categorization.

## Segment "Mature Single"

The Mature Single segment represents the largest customer group with 1,664 users (37.7% of total customer base). These customers are aged 35-64, unmarried, 
and demonstrate flexible travel patterns with premium spending preferences. They show strong interest in cultural experiences and educational tours, prioritizing 
quality over cost. The recommended perk focuses on premium experiences and cultural tour packages.

## Segment "Couple Traveler"

Couple Travelers constitute 1,030 users (23.3%) and are characterized as married individuals without children aged 35-64. They typically travel in pairs 
and prioritize romantic experiences and quality time together. Common experiences and shared activities are highly valued by this segment. 
The tailored perk offers romantic upgrades and couples spa packages.

## Segment "Family Traveler"

These are 717 travelers (16.3 %) who are characterized by the fact that they have children and a longer trip duration of more than 5 nights. 
Over 30% of their trips take place during summer vacations and require multiple seats with a higher luggage capacity. They prefer apartment-style 
stays with multiple rooms to meet the needs of the family. The benefits package includes offers such as “kids fly free” and entertainment packages for families.

## Segment "Single Traveler"

Single Travelers account for 519 users (11.8%) and are typically unmarried individuals under 35 years old. They demonstrate flexible and spontaneous travel 
behavior with above-average hotel price preferences. Adventure and unique experiences are key motivators for this segment's travel decisions. 
The perk offering includes solo traveler bonuses and city tour credits.

## Segment "Business Traveler"

The business traveler segment includes 318 users (8.6 %) who are characterized by short trips of 2-3 nights, 70 % of which take place on weekdays. 
They are under 65 years old and usually book 1-2 seats with minimal luggage requirements. They prefer accommodation in single rooms to meet their 
professional requirements. Priority check-in and lounge access meet their requirements for efficiency and comfort.

## Segment "Senior Traveler"

The senior traveler segment includes 103 users (2.3%) and is the smallest but most significant segment of the 65+ age group. They prefer longer 
stays of 7+ nights and travel 40% or less during peak season. They prefer premium properties and luxury features and prefer double rooms or suites. 
Senior discounts and flexible booking options make up their targeted perks package.

## Recommendations

Strategic Recommendations Priority focus should target the Mature Single segment (37.7%) with premium cultural experiences for maximum revenue impact. 
Quick wins can be achieved by implementing Business Traveler perks first due to high willingness to pay. Revenue optimization focuses on premium segments 
representing 48.6% of customers with above-average spending. Technology integration and partnership development support long-term personalization goals.

## Implementation

Implementation strategy Immediate measures include activating automatic segmentation by integrating SQL algorithms and implementing perk displays in user 
dashboards. Medium-term goals focus on building partnership networks and improving the mobile app with A/B testing frameworks. The long-term vision includes 
AI-powered personalization, global expansion and premium loyalty programs. The strategic implementation ensures the systematic rollout of segment-specific perks.

## Supporting data

Supporting data section contains tables and charts to support the segmentation analysis. The customer segment overviews provide a detailed breakdown of key 
characteristics, demographics and travel behavior. Visual representations include bar charts showing the distribution of users and pie charts showing the 
percentage breakdown. Individual user examples demonstrate the practical application of segment allocation and benefit allocation.
